# Music Player Project

This is a simple music player project implemented in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project includes a music player with features such as adding songs, removing songs, and playlist navigation.

This was built using Doubly Linked List data structure. The playlist is implemented as a doubly linked list. The songs are added to the playlist as nodes. The playlist is traversed using the next and previous pointers of the nodes.

This was done as part of my PDSA course work project at NIBM.

## Features

- Add songs to the playlist dynamically.
- Remove songs from the playlist.
- Navigate through the playlist.
- Responsive design.
- Dark/light theme switch.
